# snake.gba
 A broken snake on GBA!
 
 uh so yeah
 
 i tried to learn how to make a gba game with [butano](https://github.com/GValiente/butano), but it turns out i'm really stupid and i gave up on it, mostly because i noticed way too late that the way i did everything was incorrect, so what you are looking at is a really broken snake for the GBA!
 
 (you can't even win because i noticed way too late that there is a limit on the amount of sprites displayed on screen, and each body part is a different sprite)
